\usage{
make_ll_model(taxa, df, geo_cols, random_col = "grid_l", out_file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character name of taxa for which model is being run. Used to name
output file.}

\item{df}{Cleaned, filtered data frame.}

\item{geo_cols}{Character name of columns in \code{df} containing geographic
context. Last index in \code{geo_cols} is used as primary analysis level.}

\item{random_col}{Character name of column in \code{df} containing random factor
for model. This is usually the larger of two (probably raster) grid cell
sizes.}

\item{out_file}{Path to file where model results are/will be saved.}

\item{...}{Passed to rstanarm::stan_gamm4 (e.g. chains, iter)}
}
\value{
\code{fs::path(out_path,paste0("list-length_mod_",taxa,".rds"))}
